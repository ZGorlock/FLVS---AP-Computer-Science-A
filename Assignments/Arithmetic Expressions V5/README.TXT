**************************** P M R *********************************************
 
<+s>: Learned how to declare a variable as different types in Java.
      Got to practice with print statements
      
<-s>: It was very tedious, I probably wouldnt have used variables in this situation if I had a choice.
           
*******************************************************************************
In the future I would use variable only when the values are going to be changing or might be changed, not just to do a predefined math problem.
