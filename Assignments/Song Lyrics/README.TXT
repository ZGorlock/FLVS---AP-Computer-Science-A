<+s>: Using notpad made it much easier to set everything up before putting it into BlueJay.
      The String litterals allowed me to type certain lines only once.
      
<-s>: Finding a simple song was hard.
           
*******************************************************************************
I will definitely use Notepad to organize my code before putting it into BlueJay in the future.
