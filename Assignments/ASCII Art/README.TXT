**************************** P M R *********************************************
 
<+s>: The ASCII art was fun to draw.
      
<-s>: The escape characters made it hard to visualize the image as I was typing it.
           
*******************************************************************************
Next time I need to make ASCII art I will draw it in a text document and then Ctrl-h and replace all \ with \\ and such to make it easier.
