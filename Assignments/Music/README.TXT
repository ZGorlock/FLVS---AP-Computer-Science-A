PROJECT TITLE: Sequential Search
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Searches through a library of music

**************************** P M R *********************************************
 
<+s>: Fairly basic program set-up
      
<-s>: Sequential searches are the slowest search algorithm.
           
*******************************************************************************
The search algorithms are familiar to me so they were not hard to understand. It is useful to be able to search through an array.








PROJECT TITLE: Binary Search
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Searches through a library of music
VERSION or DATE: 04-25-2013
AUTHORS: Zachary Gill

**************************** P M R *********************************************
 
<+s>: Mostly the same as the last program
      Im glad I only had to do binary search for one of the search methods
      
<-s>: I had trouble implementing the binary search.
      Tried and failed to implement the linearPrint method, but it is uneccesary in this program I think.

The search algorithms are familiar to me so they were not hard to understand. It is useful to be able to search through an array. The binary search is faster than the sequential search, but it is harder to understand and implement.
