<+s>: This project wasnt as complicated as some others
      Static methods make some things easier
      
<-s>: My output from 7.03 was in m/s^2 not relative to earths gravity
           
*******************************************************************************
This project allowed me to practice my newly learned ability to make static methods and it let my program be shorter and easier to understand.
