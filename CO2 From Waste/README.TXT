This was a pretty easy project, but I spent a lot of time at the beginnning trying to make an ArrayList that contained int and boolean that I could then pass into CO2FromWaste objects so I was just making them into objects but I kept having issues, I didn't think to just make an ArrayList of CO2FromWaste objects.
