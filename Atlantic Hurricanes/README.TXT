<+s>: Formatting is getting easier.
      
<-s>: Made a lot of mistakes.

I think it would be nice to learn how to redimension arrays, this would be better if we didnt know the number of elements in a file that we need to store in an array. Also, I think it would have been easier to just have all the processing occur as it was being read rather than in individual loops. And what benifit is the there to using Integer.MAX_VALUE and Integer.MIN_VALUE when you could just set the min and max or that youre trying to find to the first element in the array youre searching?
