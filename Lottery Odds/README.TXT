**************************** P M R *********************************************
 
<+s>: Random numbers weren't hard to get.
      
<-s>: Had to look up int to String conversions and review String comparison methods.
           
*******************************************************************************
I made a version that compared only the whole number before I elaborated and made it win if you had front or end pairs.
