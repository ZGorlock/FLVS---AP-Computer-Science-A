Zack's Grilled Cheese

I like parkour and computers.
I decided to take AP Computer Science to take an aditional elective class.

Collect butter (or appropriate substitute), bread, cheese slices (or appropriate substitute), a pan, and a spatula.
Turn the oven on medium heat.
Butter one side of a slice of bread and put it in the pan over the burner, butter down.
Place a cheese slice onto the bread in the pan.
Butter a second piece of bread and place it, butter up, on top of the cheese in the pan.
Use the spatula to flip the sandwich.
Continue to flip until both sides are golden brown.
Remove and consume.
